### Key Insights from the State of Platform Engineering (Vol. 3)

**What Students Must Understand About the Future of DevOps & Platform Engineering**

#### 1. Platform Engineering Is No Longer “Optional”

Platform Engineering has moved from an emerging idea to a **mainstream engineering discipline**. More than **55% of platform teams are less than 2 years old**, showing that organizations are actively building platforms _now_, not experimenting casually .\
T**akeaway:** This is a high-growth career path with strong demand.

#### 2. “Platform as a Product” Is the Core Mindset

The most consistent theme across the report and PlatformCon is that **successful platforms are treated like products**, not internal tooling projects.\
This means:

* Developers are customers
* Platforms need roadmaps, feedback loops, and adoption strategies
* Success is measured by outcomes, not just tooling

Teams that fail usually build tools **for engineers**, not **with engineers** .\
T**akeaway:** Platform Engineering is as much **product thinking** as it is technical skill.

#### 3. Portals Are Interfaces — Not the Platform

There was a **90% drop** in talks focused only on developer portals compared to last year. Why?\
Because portals (like Backstage) are now understood as **frontends**, not the platform itself. The real value lies in:

* Backend orchestration
* Standardized infrastructure workflows
* Automation logic

Starting with a portal is compared to _“building a house starting with the front door”_ .\
T**akeaway:** Learn backend platform design before UI tools.

#### 4. Platform Orchestrators Are the New Backbone

Modern platforms are shifting away from CI/CD-only (pipeline-based) designs toward **graph-based backends**, also called **Platform Orchestrators**.\
Why?

* CI/CD pipelines don’t scale well for complex environments
* Graph-based systems manage dependencies, environments, and policies cleanly
* Developers define _what they need_, not _how to build it_

This is a major architectural shift in how platforms are built .\
T**akeaway:** Expect platforms to be **API-driven orchestration systems**, not just YAML pipelines.

#### 5. DevEx Alone Is Not Enough

Earlier platform efforts over-optimized for Developer Experience (DevEx). The report shows a strong correction:

* **68% of teams prioritize infrastructure standardization**
* **65% focus on DevEx**\
  The winning approach balances **developers + infrastructure + operations**.

Platform engineering is described as a **“multiplayer game”**, not a developer-only initiative .\
T**akeaway:** Strong infra knowledge is as important as developer empathy.

#### 6. Most Organizations Are Still Immature

Using the CNCF Platform Engineering Maturity Model, the report shows:

* Most companies are in **early or mid-maturity stages**
* Measurement is the weakest area
* **42% don’t measure platform success at all**

Many teams _believe_ they are mature but lack real metrics to prove impact .\
T**akeaway:** Knowing _how to measure platform success_ is a rare and valuable skill.

#### 7. Tooling Trends Students Should Track

Key tools dominating real-world platforms:

* **IaC:** Terraform (71%)
* **Kubernetes:** Managed K8s (EKS, AKS, GKE)
* **Observability:** Prometheus leads
* **Portals:** Backstage still dominant
* **New category:** Cloud Development Environments (CDEs)

Tool choice reflects **standardization and scale**, not hype .\
T**akeaway:** Learn fundamentals first, tools second.

#### 8. Platform Engineers Earn More Than DevOps Engineers

The salary data is clear:

* Platform Engineers earn **22–26% more** than DevOps engineers
* Demand is growing faster than supply
* Many platform engineers don’t even have “Platform Engineer” in their title yet

T**akeaway:** Platform skills are a **career accelerator**, not a niche.

### Summary

Platform Engineering represents the **next evolution of DevOps**:

* Less hero-driven ops
* More standardized systems
* Strong product thinking
* Clear business outcomes

Those who understand **architecture, automation, product mindset, and measurement** will define the next decade of engineering.
